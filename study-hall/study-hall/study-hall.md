# What are some situations where it's imperative to have everyone at the same skill level? 

## What are some other scenarios where people on a team need extreme specialties? Consider writing it down. Share it with the team.

Any situation where you have 2 or more people working towards a shared goal (like building a website) is where it's important to have a shared foundation.

A scenario where you would want specialization is goal-specific. When making a website, you have certain common goals. These common goals require a tool of choice. Some of these goals overlap at times (like user experience and accessibility, or programming and user interaction). 

I did my best to compile a list below. The hieracrhy/categories may not be the best, and I am sure I will update/combine information as my knowledge and experience build. Some of the tools and goals that require specialization are

- Programming for The Web
	- HTML
	- CSS
	- Client-side programming
		- JavaScript (JS)
	- Server-side	programming
		- PHP
		- SQL
			- Database design
	- The differences between client and server-side programming			
	- Various frameworks

		- SAAS(Software As A Service)

- Developer tooling
	- CSS preprocessors
		- SCSS
		- Stylus
	- Browser developer tools

			-	To view the website as varying devices(mobile, ipad, etc...)

- DevOps
	- Hosting
	- Deploying code to the Web

			- i.e smaller (less resource intensive) for mobile
	- Logo design	

- Agile workflow
	- Timeboxing
	-	Tools that facilate working agile

		- Slack

- Appearance
	- CSS
		- Colors
		- Typography

			- Feature detection

- Soft skills
	- Time management

			- team members 
			-	Stakeholders
			- Customers
	- Mentoring

I think everyone involved in making certain aspects of a website (be realistic, I would't expect a content writer to be able to program) should have exposure to these concepts, but to expect everyone to specialize in each concept isnt realistic, especially considering the depth of information  (see the sublists).
