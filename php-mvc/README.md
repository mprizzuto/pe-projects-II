GOAL: build a php MVC multipage website. MVC is a programmign paradigm that stands for :

- model

- view
	- The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user and handling user interface components.
- controller.  It generates HTML or other output to be sent to the client's browser. 
	-  It receives user input, processes it, and interacts with the Model to update the data or retrieve data. It then communicates with the View to display the appropriate response to the user.
