							<p>Now more than even in a post-pandemic world, where people are going out less and food prices are rising. The benefits of being a home-baker include</p>
						</header>

						<ul class="reasons-to-bake">
							<li><strong>control over ingredients.</strong> When you buy bread from a store, it is usually heavily processed. The healthiest bread has only four ingredients 
								<li>
									<ul class="ingredient-list">
										<li>flour</li>
										<li>water</li>
										<li>salt</li>
										<li>yeast</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</li>

							<li><strong>cost effective.</strong> a good loaf of <em>artisan bread</em> can cost <strong>$8+ dollars</strong>. Why not spend that money on a bag of flour and make multiple loaves of bread instead?</li>

							<li><strong>it's therapeutic!</strong> Baking bread at home is good for your mental health. There is nothing like watching the flour absorb the water and mixing all the ingredients together to distract you from your problems.</li>

							<h2 class="section-title">Bakers math</h2>

							<p>I know, math is scary, right?! not really, atleast when you have the foundations down. When reading bread recipes, you may encounter something called the <mark>baker's percent</mark></p>
						</header>

						<p>When calculating how much of an ingredient to add to a batch of dough, us Bakers weight the flour and base the percent of the ingredients on the total amount of flour. Say you have 500 grams(g) of flour.</p>

						<ul class="ingredient-list">
							<li>
								<strong>water</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>if we want the dough to be 80% hydration, 80% * 500g = <mark>400g of water</mark></li>
								</ul>
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>salt</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>Recipes vary, though it is standard for bread dough to usually have around 2-2.5% of salt<mark>(non-iodized is best)</mark>. so, 2.5 * 500g = <mark>12.5g salt</mark> </li>
								</ul>
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>yeast(sourdough starter or instant yeast)</strong>
								<ul>
									<li>again, this is up to you. some recipes call for more or less of a rising agent. Less yeast means more time to develop flavor, but longer rising times.<mark>10% starter</mark> or <mark>.5% to 2% yeast</mark>. lets choose sourdough starter for our recipe. 10% of 500g = 50g of active(recently risen) starter </li>
